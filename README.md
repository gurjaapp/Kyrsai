## Kyrsai - Shellcode Injector 

Kyrsai is a shellcode injector designed to inject dll's into target processes. 

Im basing it off crow's maldev video series so this is in no way perfect but still pretty cool

ik this is github but i will never ever release the source code cuz i love ratting people 🐀
